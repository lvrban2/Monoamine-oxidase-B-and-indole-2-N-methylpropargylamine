This repository hosts files neccesary to reproduce results obtained in the following manuscript:

Vrban, L.; Vianello, R. ; The high potency of indole-2-N-methylpropargylamine in irreversibly inhibiting monoamine oxidase B relevant for neurodegeneration: A computational insight based on the scaffold analysis (2024).


The repository comprises three primary directories delineating distinct procedural phases: docking, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations, and density functional theory (DFT) mechanistic simulations. Within the 'DOCKING' directory, you will find the AutoDock Vina generated energy and positional outputs for 25 analyzed scaffolds (*log,*pdbqt) alongside outputs for the 7 meticulously chosen ligands, the justification for the selection is detailed within the accompanying manuscript. The 'MD' directory houses input files (*gro,*top) intended for GROMACS simulations pertinent to the aforementioned ligands. Lastly, the 'DFT' directory encompasses Gaussian input geometries for the three 'hit' ligands (*com), with control files provided for selegiline and rasagiline across all three procedural stages.
